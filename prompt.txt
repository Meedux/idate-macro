Remove CV dection in the program completely and just use memory detection and reader, and also the current implementation is not working as it's not detecting when it must execute a macro and it is just frantically spamming random macro inputs, additionally use a library to improve the implementation and also you missed the hand note or the space note not just the 4 notes

FIX THE ERRORS AND ITERATE ALL OVER THEM UNTIL IT IS DONE!

USE TEST FILES TO TEST MEMORY VALUES AND ITERATE ALOT OF TIMES UNTIL YOU GET THE DESIRED RESULT!

Additionally the Detection overlay is not showing the note detection SO MAKE SURE MEMORY READER AND DETECTION OVERLAY ARE ALIGNED WITH EACH OTHER PROPERLY!

While you are testing on getting the specific memory values you can certainly assume that the I, the user is playing the game on the background 

Additionally you would just need to get the following
The Notes in order from left to right
Time frame of each notes that are needed to be triggered by their corresponding inputs that will be executed by the macro
and the position of the notes in the game(X and Y pos) that will be given to the overlay and display it as a detection.
finally you can create many test files as you like to validate the overlay, notes and vice versa

while testing since I am playing it on the background you can always include the overlay detection that will be put ontop of the target game window and take a screenshot and manually verify it yourself to check if you are reading the right memory

Again I want you to fully automate this plan -> test -> implement -> repeat workflow again and again until you have the expected results

you are allowed to use third party libraries but do not hallucinate on their documentation and instead use context7


---------------------------------------------------------
Hello, instead of actively searching through the memory of the target program while it is running the background, i have created a dump folder with two files, the dumped exe file and the C file decompiled from the exe file

Now your task here is to search through the entirety of the dumped files, you may decompile the exe file using a third party library again, but remember to use context7

Your task here is as follows:
Remove Template Based Detection altogether but keep the templates folder,
Search through the dumped files to get accurate results on what to read 
You would need to get the following:
    - The Notes that will be executed in order
    - The timeframe where the notes would be executed
    - Which of the notes are needed to be executed within the timeframe
    - the corresponding inputs of the notes that are needed to be executed within the timeframe

Since the exe is a decompiled program it is upto you how you could test it out, you can use Ghidra MCP to decompile the exe file again. 

Additionally you should completely wipe out the CV templated-based detection as it is not required anymore, I wish to completely remove the mentioned feature both in the codebase and in the program altogether but keep the templates folder files
