# Keymap configuration for rhythm game inputs
# Maps lane indices and directional inputs to keyboard keys

[directions]
# Single direction inputs
up = "up"
down = "down"
left = "left"
right = "right"

# Combo direction inputs (two keys pressed simultaneously)
up_left = ["up", "left"]
down_left = ["down", "left"]
up_right = ["up", "right"]
down_right = ["down", "right"]

[lanes]
# Map each lane index to a key or direction
# For 8-lane mode, typical mapping:
# Lanes 0-3: left hand (a, s, d, f or arrows)
# Lanes 4-7: right hand (j, k, l, ; or arrows)

# Using arrow keys for 4-lane:
# 0 = "left"
# 1 = "down"
# 2 = "up"
# 3 = "right"

# Using arrows + combos for 8-lane:
0 = "left"
1 = "down"
2 = "up"
3 = "right"
4 = ["up", "left"]      # up_left
5 = ["down", "left"]    # down_left
6 = ["up", "right"]     # up_right
7 = ["down", "right"]   # down_right

[timing]
# Key press duration in milliseconds
press_duration_ms = 30

# Minimum gap between consecutive presses (same key)
min_gap_ms = 10

# Stagger delay for chord keys in milliseconds (0 = simultaneous)
chord_stagger_ms = 0

[aliases]
# Human-readable aliases for complex inputs
# These can be referenced in patterns
low_left = "down_left"
low_right = "down_right"
